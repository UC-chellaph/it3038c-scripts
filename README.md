# it3038c-scripts
 This repository was created by Prateek Chellani for the IT3038C - Scripting Languages class, while at UC in the Spring semester of 2021. 
 The class will involve scripts created in Bash, Powershell, Python and NodeJS. 
 Feel free to leave feedback on how any of the scripts can be improved!
 Thanks
